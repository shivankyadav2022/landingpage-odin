# landingpage-odin

I am taking up the task to develop a full fledged landing page to complete my odin project.

This is the first time I am going to build a landing page of this magnitude.
I will be using flex , css and basic HTML all the things I have learned so far in this project.
In addition there will be some other things that are minor and related to already introduced concepts, 
I will be extensively using google searches and even LLM AIs to help me understand the new concepts needed for my project.

The first question was where to start. I decided to write the basic barebone HTML for the whole page and then style each of the 
elements one by one once the basic structure is ready. 

There are total five vertical sections in the landing page. One header, one footer and and three content in between. 
I decided to arrange the whole body using flex because this way it will be easier to align various broad elements of the page. 

First I build the header section. It contains logo , links , website heading , signup button etc, I arranged various items according to the desired layout using multiple nested flexboxes and fonts , size, color etc as given in the assignment. 

For the next rows also I tackled the styling one by one matching the elements with the desired output leaving me with a page
that resembles a lot with the given desired output image.
